  RISC-V Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering the RISC-V Architecture including the applications, libraries and tools that will make you a better and more efficient developer with the RISC-V ISA.

## Resources

[RISC-V Foundation](https://riscv.org/) is a non-profit corporation controlled by its 500 members(NVIDIA, Google, Samsung, Raspberry Pi, SiFive, Canonical, and Western Digital) to drive forward the adoption and implementation of the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).

[SiFive](https://www.sifive.com/) is a semiconductor company that produces complete RISC-V processors IP with pre-integrated SiFive Shield, for whole SoC security, and SiFive Insight advanced trace and debug.

## Tools

[RISC-V Interpreter](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/) is a online Interpreter for RISC-V build by Cornell University.

[Chipyard](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an open source framework for agile development of Chisel-based systems-on-chip. It will allow you to leverage the Chisel HDL, Rocket Chip SoC generator, and other [Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu/) projects to produce a RISC-V SoC with everything from MMIO-mapped peripherals to custom accelerators.

[The Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins) is a collection of plug-ins for Arm & RISC-V C/C++ developers.

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a professional collaborative platform for embedded development with no vendor lock-in. It provides support for multiplatforms and frameworks such as IoT, Arduino, CMSIS, ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, libOpenCM3, mbed OS, Pulp OS, SPL, STM32Cube, Zephyr RTOS, ARM, AVR, Espressif (ESP8266/ESP32), FPGA, MCS-51 (8051), MSP430, Nordic (nRF51/nRF52), NXP i.MX RT, PIC32, RISC-V.

[PlatformIO for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) is a plugin that provides support for the PlatformIO IDE on VSCode.

[Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) is a graphical processor simulator and assembly editor for the RISC-V instruction set architecture(ISA).

[FireSim](https://github.com/firesim/firesim) is an easy-to-use, Scalable, FPGA-accelerated Cycle-accurate Hardware Simulation.

[Tock](https://www.tockos.org/) is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. 

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is a Go compiler(based on LLVM) intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (Wasm), and command-line tools.

[LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/) is a library that has collection of modular/reusable compiler and toolchain  components (assemblers, compilers, debuggers, etc.). With these components LLVM can be used as a compiler framework, providing a front-end(parser and lexer) and a back-end (code that converts LLVM's representation to actual machine code).

[Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) is a lightweight, multi-platform, multi-architecture CPU emulator framework(ARM, AArch64, M68K, Mips, Sparc, X86) based on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

[Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture(Arm, Arm64, Hexagon, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86) assembler framework.

[Reko](https://github.com/uxmal/reko) is a decompiler for machine code binaries.

[Renode](https://renode.io/) is [Antmicro's](https://antmicro.com) virtual development framework for multinode embedded networks (both wired and wireless) and is intended to enable a scalable workflow for creating effective, tested and secure IoT systems.

[Jupiter](https://jupitersim.gitbook.io/) is an open source and education-oriented RISC-V assembler and runtime simulator written in Java.

[RISC-V Rust](https://github.com/takahirox/riscv-rust) is a RISC-V processor and peripheral devices emulator project written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.
